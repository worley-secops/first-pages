# Secure Coding Guidelines
## Introduction
The security principles and guidelines are intended as a consistent, holistic framework to provide Degreed Engineers, Designers, Product Managers and QA Engineers. The provide clear best practices and patterns to follow to help us to design and implement a secure platform from the codebase up.

All members of the Degreed Experience Organisation, and in particular the Engineers, Tech Leads, and QA Engineers, should be intimately familiar with these principles and guidelines.

## Degreed Information Security Program
These principles and guidelines, are intended to support the [Policies](https://degreedjira.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/InfoQA/pages/536150040/Policies) and [Standards](https://degreedjira.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/InfoQA/pages/589463709) defined in the [Degreed Information Security Program](https://degreedjira.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/InfoQA/pages/605552739/Degreed+Information+Security+Program).
